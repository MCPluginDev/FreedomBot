# FreedomBot
FreedomBot. The bot of freedom. Helps admins do their job easier.

  FreedomBot is a small plugin currently under development by the MCPluginDev team. The plugin is an "artificial admin" to help Free-OP server owner's administrate their Free-OP server. Origianally created by FoxIshDaBest and a team of developers from SecreticOP, FreedomBot has over time been moved to the [RainbowFreedomDev organization](https://github.com/RainbowFreedomDev/FreedomBot) (which is now no longer active) and then to the [MCPluginDev organization](https://github.com/MCPluginDev/) (where it is now). The plugin was a small side-project to developing the SecreticOPMod, and now is growing fast.
